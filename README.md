### What Is A DDos-Attack

### A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a hostile attempt to block normal traffic from a server, service, or network by overwhelming the victim or surrounding infrastructure by flooding it with Internet traffic. DDoS attacks achieve effectiveness by leveraging multiple compromised computer systems as sources of attack.
